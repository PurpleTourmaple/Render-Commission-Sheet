## Render Commission Sheet

#### What I can do:
- Static Renders/Posters
- Profile pictures
- Headers

#### What I won't do:
- Complex modelling/sculpting (I can make an exception for light modelling, such as props or fixing models)

## Pricing:

#### Render:
- Starts at **$40** for a single character and a single render
- Additional character: **$15**

#### Alternative Renders:
- Simple alternative render (alt outfit, alt angle, alt character, etc): **$10**
- Alternative scene: **starts at $25** + alts if any
- If the total price of the commission is high enough, a discount of **35%** can be offered to additional alts, if more are needed! Meaning even more alts for less!

#### Background:
- Single color, transparent, pattern: **$0**
- 3D Scene: **$10**

#### Simulations:
- Clothes (falling/dropped, realistic fitting, etc): **$10**

ℹ️ The price depends on how many alts you need, since models may be altered or re-made per-outfit or per-character

## Rules and Process:
- You **𝗠𝗨𝗦𝗧** be **𝟭𝟴+** to request a commission.

- After applying for a commission, it will be in a **queue** and you will be contacted as soon as a slot becomes available. A commission **takes time**. I won't do multiple commissions for one request.

- Commissions must be paid in advance via **PayPal** and I have the right to decline a request before payment. A **link** for the payment will be given to you with the confirmation. (Changes to the commission can be made up to this point, before payment)

- When a commission have been started, **refunds** will depend on the **amount of work** that have been put into your request.
	- Full refund before work starts
	- 50% if work is halfway done
	- No refund if final render is complete

- Once done, the commission will be **sent via email** to ensure the image quality is kept intact. (Unless told otherwise). An exception is made for large numbers of renders, those will be on my personal **Goggle Drive**, but if they get deleted, just let met know and I'll send them again.
